# Submit a Group Buy

Thanks for your interest in submitting a group buy to Keeb DB. Unfortunately, I don't have that functionality working yetâ€”it'll be a little bit longer until you can submit things directly to the database.

Until then, if you have a group buy that you would like me to put into the system, please send a message to **PureGarlic#7300** on Discord, and we can talk more there. Or, you can always check out the <Link to="/">group buys that I've painstakingly imported by hand</Link>.
